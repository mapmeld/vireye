# VirEYE

Experimental research based on 1batch, MongoDB, and Neo4j.

The VirEYE platform will allow researchers to share formal papers, data, methods,
and more casual observations in an open forum.

Open science over trust networks

#### Example use case

Recent efforts to treat and contain outbreaks of Ebola and Zika virus make it
more important than ever to have open and reliable information about a disease.

Ebola and zika are scary, but we know from human history that pandemics can be
even worse. It's zero-days for people, where we don't know what nature might
throw at us next.

If I read a paper on zika, or want to gather data on my own, it's difficult
to search these new networks for an epidemiologist in Brazil or the best census
dataset for Venezuela. I can probably find a Venezuela census, but how do I
find the most recent, trustworthy, and machine-readable datasets, especially
when I just arrived in this space?  The best option is to include a trust
network, which highlights sources recommended by people who I've worked with
in a previous pre-crisis context.

We should set up this platform today, because accessible open science data is
needed today in non-crisis situations. Then when the next crisis occurs, we
don't have to wait for awareness and interest to build in the tech community,
by which time their ability to understand, connect with, and influence crisis
responders is limited.  Many hackathon ideas are unused a few days or weeks
later. VirEYE will always be running in the background and working to support
students who will later become experts.

The VirEYE platform could even form as an early-warning system. Information
about SARS was suppressed by Chinese authorities long enough to create a
global health crisis.  In early 2014 I proposed a SecureDrop instance to
share health reports with medical journals over Tor.  I spoke with early
warning experts who suggested that this platform would be useful every five
years, but it would be difficult to train people to use and monitor this
Tor info-drop location.  By setting up VirEYE as an open science portal
pre-crisis, we can remain in constant communication and build trust with
experts around the world.

The ideal platform should allow you to review data and reports from the best
local experts, with trust networks guiding you to the right sources.

#### End goals

Assembling authoritative, local data on epidemology, regional languages, and
crowdmapping -- anywhere that data should be globally open, and local networks
and trust are more important than seniority.
